# InfraWatch

This project is a monorepo structure with a simplified architecture. It includes both web and API applications in the root directory for easier development and deployment.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This monorepo includes the following applications:

### Applications
- `web/`: React web application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- `api/`: Express.js API server with TypeScript

All packages and applications are written in 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Utilities and Tools

This project uses the following tools:

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Static type checking
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: Code quality and standards
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io)**: Code formatting
- **[PNPM](https://pnpm.io)**: Fast and disk space efficient package manager

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies for the entire monorepo
pnpm install

# Or install dependencies for specific applications
cd web && pnpm install
cd api && pnpm install
```

### Environment Setup

Before starting the development environment, you need to set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your specific configuration
# The .env.example file contains all available environment variables with example values
```

**Important**: The `.env` file contains sensitive information and should never be committed to version control. Always use `.env.example` as a template.

### Starting Development Environment

```bash
# Start development server for all applications
pnpm dev

# Or start applications individually
cd web && pnpm dev    # Start web development server
cd api && pnpm dev    # Start API development server
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all applications
pnpm build

# Or build applications individually
cd web && pnpm build    # Build web application
cd api && pnpm build    # Build API application
```

### Starting Production

```bash
# Start production server after building
pnpm start

# Or start applications individually
cd web && pnpm start    # Start web production server
cd api && pnpm start    # Start API production server
```

## üìÅ Application Structure

### Web Application (`web/`)
The web application is built with React and Vite, featuring:
- Modern React with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and building
- Component-based architecture
- Internationalization (i18n) support
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### API Application (`api/`)
The API server is built with Express.js and TypeScript, featuring:
- RESTful API endpoints
- TypeScript for type safety
- Express.js framework
- Environment configuration

## üîÑ Development Workflow

This project follows a structured Git workflow for development. Here's the step-by-step process:

### 1. Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Example: git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
```

### 2. Development Process

```bash
# Make your changes
# Add files
# Test your changes locally

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system

- Add login and register components
- Implement JWT token handling
- Add protected route wrapper
- Update navigation for authenticated users"
```

### 3. Push Feature Branch

```bash
# Push branch to remote
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Create Pull Request

When you push a feature branch, GitHub will provide a link to create a Pull Request:

```
Create a pull request for 'feature/your-feature-name' on GitHub by visiting:
https://github.com/ilcann/infrawatch/pull/new/feature/your-feature-name
```

**Pull Request Template:**
- **Title**: Use conventional commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- **Description**: Include detailed explanation of changes
- **Add GitHub Copilot as Reviewer**: Always add `@github-copilot` as a reviewer for automated code review

### 5. Review Process

1. **Automated Review**: GitHub Copilot will automatically review your code
2. **Team Review**: Wait for human reviewers to approve
3. **Address Feedback**: Make necessary changes based on review comments
4. **Update PR**: Push additional commits if needed

### 6. Merge Pull Request

After approval, merge the Pull Request:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge feature branch (if merging locally)
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# Push merged changes
git push origin main

# Clean up: Delete local feature branch
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name

# Clean up: Delete remote feature branch
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

### üìã Pull Request Checklist

Before creating a Pull Request, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] GitHub Copilot is added as reviewer
- [ ] PR description clearly explains the changes
- [ ] No sensitive data is committed

### ü§ñ GitHub Copilot Integration

This project uses GitHub Copilot for automated code reviews:

1. **Automatic Assignment**: Copilot is automatically assigned as a reviewer
2. **Code Analysis**: Provides suggestions for code improvements
3. **Security Scanning**: Identifies potential security issues
4. **Best Practices**: Ensures code follows established patterns

To enable Copilot reviews:
- Add `@github-copilot` as a reviewer in every Pull Request
- Address Copilot's suggestions before requesting human review
- Use Copilot's feedback to improve code quality
